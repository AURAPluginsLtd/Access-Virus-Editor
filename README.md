# Access Virus Editor & Librarian

![Access Virus Editor](https://auraplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/access-virus-editor-oscillators-filter-env-v3b9011-1.jpg)

Access Virus Editor & Librarian is designed to control your Access Virus right from your DAW. With our Editor, you can work with your Access Virus by the same way you use your virtual instrument plug-ins. Our Editor will recall your patch settings when you open your project and the data will be sent to your Virus automatically once you open your project. Your synthesizer is always synchronized with your session! The only thing you need to worry, is that you power-up your synthesizer.
